# Bon Voyage!

Created by Autumn Lydon (@autumnlydon) and Athena Chang (@AthenaC).

## üöÄ Mission statement

Our application, ***Bon Voyage!*** is for girlies who wanna travel the world. It allows users to browse + collect passport stamps, learn about countries, and plan itineraries. Users will enjoy keeping track of places visited and planning what their next destination will be.

## API & React Router

This application will use the **REST Countries** API. Below are the documentation and specific endpoints we intend to use and the front-end pages that will use them.

- Link to API documentation: [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com/)
- API endpoint #1
  - Description of endpoint
  - List of data values used by the endpoint
- API endpoint #2
  - Description of endpoint
  - List of data values used by the endpoint
- API endpoint #3

[If your API requires an API key, say so here.]

## üë©‚Äçüíª MVP User Stories & Frontend Routes

The application will feature the following frontend routes and core features:

* On the `/account` page, users can keep track of the places they've traveled by collecting stamps.
* On the `/map` page, users can view the places they've been on a map

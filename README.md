# ***Bon Voyage!*** ‚úàÔ∏è

Created by [Autumn Lydon](https://github.com/autumnlydon) and [Athena Chang](https://github.com/AthenaC).

## üöÄ Mission statement

Our application, ***Bon Voyage!*** is for explorers who are eager to see the world. It allows users to collect digital passport stamps, discover new countries, and plan future adventures. With *Bon Voyage!*, travelers can track where they've been and dream up their next destination.

## üëæ API & React Router

This application will use the **REST Countries** API. Below are the documentation and specific endpoints we intend to use and the front-end pages that will use them.

## üë©‚Äçüíª MVP User Stories & Frontend Routes

The application will feature the following frontend routes and core features:

* On the `/` (home) page, users can sign up or log in to their account.
* On the `/passport` page, users can keep track of the places they've traveled by collecting stamps in their digital passport.
* On the `/countries` page, users can view a list of all the countries and their flags by clicking on the card.
  * When the modal pops up, users can view more information about the country.
* On the `/passport/[country]` page, users can view their adventures in the countries they visited by clicking on the colorized stamps.
  * When the modal pops up, on the same page, by clicking on the country's name, users can view more information about the country.

# ***Bon Voyage!***

Created by Autumn Lydon (@autumnlydon) and Athena Chang (@AthenaC).

## 🚀 Mission statement

Our application, ***Bon Voyage!*** is for explorers who are eager to see the world. It allows users to collect digital passport stamps, discover new countries, and plan future adventures. With Bon Voyage, travelers can track where they've been and dream up their next destination.

## 👾 API & React Router

This application will use the **REST Countries** API. Below are the documentation and specific endpoints we intend to use and the front-end pages that will use them.

  - Description of endpoint
  - List of data values used by the endpoint
- API endpoint #2

  - List of data values used by the endpoint
- API endpoint #3

[If your API requires an API key, say so here.]

## 👩‍💻 MVP User Stories & Frontend Routes

The application will feature the following frontend routes and core features:

* On the `/account` page, users can keep track of the places they've traveled by collecting stamps.
* On the `/map` page, users can view the places they've been on a map.
* On the `/account/[country]` page, users can view more information about the country.

## 🤔 Stretch User Stories

If time permits, the following stretch features will be implemented in order of priority:

* Users will be able to view different countries by zooming in.
* Users will be able to view other users’ recommendations on the map.
* Users will be able to collect more countries’ stamps.
* Users will be able to see the visa requirements between two countries.
